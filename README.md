## Concurrent Mode (Experimental)

**Caution:**

This repository describes **experimental features that are [not yet available](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-adoption.html) in a stable release**. Don’t rely on experimental builds of React in production apps. These features may change significantly and without a warning before they become a part of React.

This documentation is aimed at early adopters and people who are curious. If you’re new to React, don’t worry about these features — you don’t need to learn them right now.
